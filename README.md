### Tariq Yunusa

Hi there! I'm Tariq Yunusa, a passionate software developer with a deep love for crafting interactive digital experiences that go beyond just looking good — they feel good too. My work lives at the intersection of aesthetics and usability, where every animation, transition, and detail is carefully considered to serve both form and function.

I’m particularly drawn to building smooth, immersive interfaces that engage users without overwhelming them. Whether it's a complex frontend interaction or a seamless user journey, I enjoy solving problems with clean, expressive code and a strong eye for design. I'm constantly exploring new tools, technologies, and creative patterns to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

Let’s build things that people not only use — but remember.
